# What is ARRAY in JavaScript
##### An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same type, in a contiguous block of memory. In JavaScript, an array is a special type of object that allows for storing multiple values in a single variable. Arrays in JavaScript can hold different types of elements, such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays. They are commonly used for storing and manipulating lists of data.

### Array Methods:
JavaScript provides a wide range of built-in methods to manipulate arrays. Let's explore some commonly used ones:

1. push() and pop():
- push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
- pop(): Removes the last element from an array.

2. shift() and unshift():
- shift(): Removes the first element from an array.
- unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.

3. concat():
- Combines two or more arrays and returns a new array.

4. slice():
- Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array.

5. splice():
- Changes the contents of an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements.

6. forEach():
- Executes a provided function once for each array element.

7. map():
- Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.

8. filter():
- Creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by a provided function.

9. reduce():
- Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.

### Array Method callbacks
1. forEach(): The forEach() method calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, in ascending order. This is useful for iterating through the array and performing some operation on each element.

2. map(): The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. This is useful for transforming the elements in the array and creating a new array with the transformed values.

3. filter(): The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. This is useful for filtering out elements from the array based on a certain condition.

4. reduce(): The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value. This is useful for performing some operation on all elements in the array and returning a single value.
